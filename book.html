        <h2><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2>
        <div class="faq">
          <h3>Q1. How much is it?</h3>
          <p>A. Your treatment will only be $199 (Valued at $500)</p>
  
          <h3>Q2. How long is each session?</h3>
          <p>A. Under 90 minutes!</p>
  
          <h3>Q3. How fast will I see results?</h3>
          <p>A. You can see results as quickly as your first session!</p>
  
          <h3>Q4. How many sessions are needed?</h3>
          <p>A. You will notice results as soon as your first session. For best results, about 3-5 sessions are recommended. But this varies from person to person.</p>
  
          <h3>Q5. How does it work?</h3>
          <p>A. This non-invasive treatment uses a simultaneous application of heating and cooling with a massage wand to reduce fat and tighten skin.<br><br>
          There is zero downtime, and it is completely painless and non-invasive.<br><br>
          The facial sculpts and tightens the face to get rid of loose & saggy skin as well as excess fat on the face, including double chins.<br><br>
          The combination of both gives you a more sculpted appearance and tighter waistline with an instant face lift that firms, brightens, and eliminates wrinkles.</p>
  
          <h3>Q6. Does it hurt?</h3>
          <p>A. Not at all! We use a massaging technique that our clients find relaxing and even sleep inducing. The alternating heating and cooling sensation also adds to the therapeutic feeling and minimal discomfort is observed.</p>
  
          <h3>Q7. How long do results last?</h3>
          <p>A. Results are permanent! Which is why repeated sessions can increase your overall transformation even more dramatically.</p>
  
          <h3>Q8. How should I prepare?</h3>
          <p>A. Sessions are completely noninvasive with zero downtime. No special preparation is necessary! However, we recommend only drinking water and fasting prior to the same day as your session for the best results possible.</p>
  
          <h3>Q9. Who can NOT have this treatment?</h3>
          <p>A. No body contouring or slimming (double chin or body) for pregnant or breastfeeding women. Additionally, it is recommended to schedule when you're out of your cycle to prevent bloating and get the best results possible.<br><br>
          No Surgery in the last 6 months.</p>
